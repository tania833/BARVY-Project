Now we are on the 'develop' branch.
Please DO NOT push anything into the 'master'.

So how will we work:
1. Make sure that you are on the develop and then 'git pull' in your terminal to get all the newest changes.
2. Create a branch based on the develop with a command like 'git checkout -b NEW BRANCH' every time you start working at new points.

Branches will be like:
feature_blabla
fix_blabla

When your work is finished push changes on your remote branch and create Pull Request.
Then we will together review code and merge your branch into the develop.
